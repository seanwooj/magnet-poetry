=Magnets

--
In the spirit of Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity, I built a web app that pits users against each other in the field of humor and bad taste. Each round, users are given a prompt, and a set of words which they arrange into poems based on the prompt. Players then vote on their favorite to determine who is the (democratically elected) King of Poems.

Technology Used:

Rails
Devise
